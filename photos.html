                <div class="item" data-title="New York 1939" data-desc="<p>The photograph is from the Gordon Andrews design archive, which documents Andrews' prolific career across a broad range of disciplines, including his interiors for the Australian Pavilion of the Comptoire Suisse trade fair in 1960 and his designs for the New South Wales and the New Zealand Government Tourist Bureaus, in 1961 and 1965 respectively. The archive also contains quite a few remarkable photographs such as this one. A second archive, also assembled by the designer, was acquired by the museum in 1992. It documents Andrews' designs for Australia's first decimal currency banknotes.

                'Before leaving by Greyhound I spent a week in New York. One night a young Scottish couple … and I shared a taxi to the Cotton Club in Harlem. After a bottle of gin, we got a little high and danced dazzlingly, or so we thought … at about 11pm, Cab Calloway arrived to lead the same group. That's when 'the joint began jumping' … From that moment we were on the moon. I cannot remember what time we left but I had to make a tough, working visit to the New York World Fair that same day and the days that followed. Luckily I was younger and stronger then.' (Gordon Andrews, A designer's life, 1993)

                During his brief but eventful stay in New York city in 1939, the young designer also managed to capture this image of three men on a street corner. 1939 New York World Fair publicity in the shape of a perisphere can be seen in the background. It seems to express some of the energy and enthusiasm of the city at a significant time in its history and perhaps some of the photographer's youthful enthusiasm too.

                Of photography, Andrews wrote in his 1987 book, Seeing:
                </p>
                <p>
                'I loved to compose everything that passed the viewing plane. … exposure, depth of field and other technicalities I didn't quite comprehend or care to bother about. … Being a designer, most of my results came instinctively; I expected the camera to be simply an extension of my mind.'
